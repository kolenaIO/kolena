# Example Integration: Rain Forecast

This example integration uses the
[Rain in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) tabular dataset to
demonstrate testing rain forecast models on Kolena.

## Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and Python dependency management. To get started,
install project dependencies from [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) by running:

```shell
poetry update && poetry install
```

## Usage

The data for this example integration lives in the publicly accessible S3 bucket `s3://kolena-public-datasets`.

First, ensure that the `KOLENA_TOKEN` environment variable is populated in your environment. See our
[initialization documentation](https://docs.kolena.io/installing-kolena/#initialization) for details.

This project defines two scripts that perform the following operations:

1. [`upload_dataset.py`](rain_forecast/upload_dataset.py) creates the Rain in Australia dataset on Kolena

2. [`upload_results.py`](rain_forecast/upload_results.py) tests a rain forecast model on the Rain in Australia dataset.

The `upload_results.py` script defines command line arguments to select which model to evaluate â€” run using the
`--help` flag for more information:

```shell
$ poetry run python3 rain_forecast/upload_results.py --help
usage: upload_results.py [-h] [--model {ann,logreg}] [--dataset DATASET]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model {ann,logreg}  Name of model to test.
  --dataset DATASET     Name of dataset to use for testing.
```
