# :kolena-flame-20: Quickstart

Install Kolena to set up rigorous and repeatable model testing in minutes.

In this quickstart guide, we'll use the
[`object_detection_2d`](https://github.com/kolenaIO/kolena/tree/trunk/examples/object_detection_2d) example integration to
demonstrate the how to curate test data and test models in Kolena.

## Install `kolena`

Install the `kolena` Python package to programmatically interact with Kolena:

=== "`pip`"

    ```shell
    pip install kolena
    ```

=== "`poetry`"

    ```shell
    poetry add kolena
    ```

## Clone the Examples

The [kolenaIO/kolena](https://github.com/kolenaIO/kolena) repository contains a number of example integrations to clone
and run directly:

</div>

To get started, clone the `kolena` repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kolenaIO/kolena.git
```

With the repository cloned, let's set up the
[`object_detection_2d`](https://github.com/kolenaIO/kolena/tree/trunk/examples/object_detection_2d) example:

```shell
cd kolena/examples/object_detection_2d
poetry update && poetry install
```

Now we're up and running and can start [creating test suites](#create-test-suites) and
[testing models](#test-a-model).

## Create Test Suites

Each of the example integrations comes with scripts for two flows:

1. `seed_test_suite.py`: Create test cases and test suite(s) from a source dataset
2. `seed_test_run.py`: Test model(s) on the created test suites

Before running [`seed_test_suite.py`](https://github.com/kolenaIO/kolena/blob/trunk/examples/object_detection_2d/object_detection_2d/seed_test_suite.py),
let's first configure our environment by populating the `KOLENA_TOKEN`
environment variable. Visit the [:kolena-developer-16: Developer](https://app.kolena.io/redirect/developer) page to
generate an API token and copy and paste the code snippet into your environment:

```shell
export KOLENA_TOKEN="********"
```

We can now create test suites using the provided seeding script:

```shell
poetry run python3 object_detection_2d/seed_test_suite.py
```

After this script has completed, we can visit the [:kolena-test-suite-16: Test Suites](https://app.kolena.io/redirect/testing)
page to view our newly created test suites.

In this `object_detection_2d` example, we've created test suites stratifying the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#overview) 2014 validation set (which is stored as a CSV in
S3) into test cases by brightness and bounding box size. In this example will be looking at the following labels:

`["bicycle", "car", "motorcycle", "bus", "train", "truck", "traffic light", "fire hydrant", "stop sign"]`

## Test a Model

After we've created test suites, the final step is to test models on these test suites. The `object_detection_2d` example
provides the following models to choose from `{yolo_r, yolo_x, mask_rcnn, faster_rcnn, yolo_v4s, yolo_v3}` for this step:

```shell
poetry run python3 object_detection_2d/seed_test_run.py "yolo_v4s"
```

!!! note "Note: Testing additional models"
    In this example, model results have already been extracted and are stored in CSV files in S3. To run a new model,
    plug it into the `infer` method in [`seed_test_run.py`](https://github.com/kolenaIO/kolena/blob/trunk/examples/object_detection_2d/object_detection_2d/seed_test_run.py).

Once this script has completed, click the results link in your console or visit
[:kolena-results-16: Results](https://app.kolena.io/redirect/results) to view the test results for this newly tested model.

## Conclusion

In this quickstart, we used an example integration from [kolenaIO/kolena](https://github.com/kolenaIO/kolena) to create
test suites from the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#overview) dataset and test the
open-source `yolo_v4s` model on these test suites.

This example shows us how to define an ML problem as a workflow for testing in Kolena, and can be arbitrarily extended
with additional metrics, plots, visualizations, and data.
