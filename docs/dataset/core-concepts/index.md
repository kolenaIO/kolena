    A **Dataset** represents a structured assembly of datapoints, essential for model evaluation. Each datapoint within a dataset combines various data types, such as images or text, traditionally segmented into test samples and metadata. This structure is immutable, ensuring data integrity and simplifying version management. Datasets provide a cohesive framework for organizing and processing model testing data, enhancing efficiency and clarity in user interaction.
