# :kolena-widget-20: Object Detection (2D)

!!! example "Experimental Feature"

    This pre-built workflow is an experimental feature. Experimental features are under active development and may
    occasionally undergo API-breaking changes.

Object Detection (OD) is a computer vision task that aims to classify and locate objects of interest presented in an
image. So, it can be viewed as a combination of localization and classification tasks.

This pre-built workflow is prepared for a 2D Object Detection problem and here is an example of using this workflow
on the COCO dataset.
