!!! warning "Experimental Feature"
    This pre-built workflow is an experimental feature. We are still actively working on improving it
    so there may be frequent updates and changes.

Object Detection (OD) is a computer vision task that aims to classify and locate objects of interest presented in an
image. So, it can be viewed as a combination of localization and classification tasks.

This pre-built workflow is prepared for a 2D Object Detection problem and here is an example of using this workflow
on the COCO dataset.
