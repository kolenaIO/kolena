# :kolena-archive-20: Legacy Definitions

!!! warning "Legacy Warning"

    Definitions in this section are considered **legacy** and should not be used for new projects.

    Existing usage of legacy modules will be supported indefinitely, but new projects should use the customizable and
    extensible `kolena.workflow` definitions instead.
