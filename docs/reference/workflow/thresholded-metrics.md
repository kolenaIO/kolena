!!! example "Experimental Feature"

    This pre-built workflow is an experimental feature. Experimental features are under active development and may
    occasionally undergo API-breaking changes.

Thresholded Metrics play a crucial role in specific contexts of model evaluation, particularly when the performance
of models is assessed based on varying threshold values. In such scenarios, these metrics are vital for accurately
interpreting the effectiveness of the models, as different thresholds can lead to markedly different performance
outcomes.
