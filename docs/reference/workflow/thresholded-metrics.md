!!! warning "Legacy Warning"

    Content in this section reflects **outdated practices** or **deprecated features**. It's recommended to avoid using these in new developments.

    While existing implementations using these features will continue to receive support, we strongly advise adopting the latest standards and tools for new projects to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

# `kolena._experimental.workflow.ThresholdedMetrics`

!!! example "Experimental Feature"

    This pre-built workflow is an experimental feature. Experimental features are under active development and may
    occasionally undergo API-breaking changes.

Thresholded Metrics play a crucial role in specific contexts of model evaluation, particularly when the performance
of models is assessed based on varying threshold values. In such scenarios, these metrics are vital for accurately
interpreting the effectiveness of the models, as different thresholds can lead to markedly different performance
outcomes.
