# :kolena-cube-20: Workflows

!!! note
    Kolena Workflows are simplified in Kolena Datasets.
    If you are setting up your Kolena environments for the first time, please refer to
    [Kolena Datasets](../dataset/index.md).

Kolena Workflows provides a framework for rigorously describing your data and model evaluation process and integrating
it into the Kolena web application for analysis and exploration.
