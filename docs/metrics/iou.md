# Intersection over Union (IoU)

Intersection over Union (IoU) measures the ratio of the intersection and the union between ground truth and inference,
ranging from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates a perfect match.  The objective of this metric is to compare inferences to
ground truths by measuring similarity between them.

As the name suggests, the IoU of two instances ($\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$) is defined as:

$$\text{IoU} \left( \text{A}, \text{B} \right) = \frac {\text{A} \cap \text{B}} {\text{A} \cup \text{B}}$$

## When Do I Use IoU?
It is often used to compare two geometries (e.g., [bounding boxes][kolena.workflow.annotation.BoundingBox],
[polygons][kolena.workflow.annotation.Polygon] or [segmentation masks][kolena.workflow.annotation.SegmentationMask])
in object detection, instance segmentation, or semantic segmentation workflows. In multi-label classification, IoU,
more likely known as the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), is used to compare set of
inference labels for a sample to the corresponding set of ground truth labels. Moreover, there are workflows such as
[action detection](https://paperswithcode.com/task/action-detection) and
[video moment retrieval](https://paperswithcode.com/task/moment-retrieval) where IoU measures the **temporal** overlap
between two time-series snippets.


Because IoU can be used on various types of data, let's look at how the metric is defined for some of these data types:

- [**2D Axis-Aligned Bounding Box**](#2d-axis-aligned-bounding-box)
- [**Segmentation Mask**](#segmentation-mask)
- [**Set of Labels**](#set-of-labels)


### 2D Axis-Aligned Bounding Box

Let's consider two 2D axis-aligned bounding boxes, $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$, and notice the highlighted overlap region,
which is always going to be a 2D axis-aligned bounding box.

![An example of a 2D axis-aligned bounding box](../assets/images/metrics-iou-2dbbox-light.svg#only-light)
![An example of a 2D axis-aligned bounding box](../assets/images/metrics-iou-2dbbox-dark.svg#only-dark)


In order to compute IoU for two 2D bounding boxes, the first step is identifying the area of the intersection box,
$(\text{A} \cap \text{B})$. The two coordinates of the intersection box, top-left and bottom-right corners, can be defined as:

$$
\text{A} \cap \text{B}\,_{\text{topleft}}
= (\max \left( x_{a1}, \, x_{b1} \right), \, \max \left( y_{a1}, \, y_{b1} \right))
$$

$$
\text{A} \cap \text{B}\,_{\text{bottomright}}
= (\min \left( x_{a2}, \, x_{b2} \right), \, \min \left(y_{a2}, \, y_{b2} \right))
$$

Once the intersection box $(\text{A} \cap \text{B})$ is identified, the area of the union, $(\text{A} \cup \text{B})$,
is simply a sum of the area of $\text{A}$ and ${\text{B}}$ minus the area of the intersection box.

$$
\text{area} \left( \text{A} \cup \text{B} \right)
= \text{area} \left( \text{A} \right) + \text{area} \left( \text{B} \right)
- \text{area} \left( \text{A} \cap \text{B} \right)
$$

Finally, IoU is calculated by taking the ratio of the area of intersection box and the area of the union region.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{IoU} \left( \text{A}, \, \text{B} \right)
&= \frac {\text{area} \left( \text{A} \cap \text{B} \right)} {\text{area} \left( \text{A} \cup \text{B} \right)} \\[1em]
&= \frac {\text{area} \left( \text{A} \cap \text{B} \right)} {\text{area} \left( \text{A} \right)
+ \text{area} \left( \text{B} \right) - \text{area} \left( \text{A} \cap \text{B} \right)}
\end{align}
$$

#### Examples: IoU of 2D Bounding Boxes
The following examples show what IoU values look like in different scenarios with 2D bounding boxes:

**Example 1: overlapping bounding boxes**

![An example of overlapping bounding boxes](../assets/images/metrics-iou-example1-light.svg#only-light)
![An example of overlapping bounding boxes](../assets/images/metrics-iou-example1-dark.svg#only-dark)

$$
\begin{align}
\text{IoU} \left( \text{A}, \, \text{B} \right)
&= \frac {(10 - 5) \times (10 - 2)} {10 \times 10 + (15 - 5) \times (12 - 2) - (10 - 5) \times (10 - 2)} \\[1em]
&= \frac {40} {100 + 100 - 40} \\[1em]
&= 0.25
\end{align}
$$

**Example 2: non-overlapping bounding boxes**

![An example of non-overlapping bounding boxes](../assets/images/metrics-iou-example2-light.svg#only-light)
![An example of non-overlapping bounding boxes](../assets/images/metrics-iou-example2-dark.svg#only-dark)

$$
\begin{align}
\text{IoU} \left( \text{A}, \, \text{B} \right)
&= \frac {0} {10 \times 10 + (15 - 10) \times (15 - 10) - 0} \\[1em]
&= \frac {0} {100 + 25 - 0} \\[1em]
&= 0.0
\end{align}
$$


**Example 3: completely matching bounding boxes**

$$
\begin{align}
\text{IoU} \left( \text{A}, \, \text{B} \right)
&= \frac {10 \times 10} {10 \times 10 + 10 \times 10 - 10 \times 10} \\[1em]
&= \frac {100} {100 + 100 - 100} \\[1em]
&= 1.0
\end{align}
$$


### Segmentation Mask

A [segmentation mask][kolena.workflow.annotation.SegmentationMask] is a 2D image where each pixel is a class label
commonly used in semantic segmentation tasks. The inference shape matches the ground truth shape (width and height),
with a channel depth equivalent to the number of class labels to be predicted. Each channel is a binary mask that
labels areas where a specific class is present:

<figure markdown>
  ![An example of segmentation mask](../assets/images/metrics-iou-seg-mask.png)
  <figcaption>From left to right: the original RGB image, the ground truth segmentation mask, and the inference segmentation mask</figcaption>
</figure>

The IoU metric measures the intersection (the number of pixels common between the ground truth and inference masks,
**true positive (TP)**) divided by the union (the total number of pixels present across both masks,
**TP + false negative (FN) + false positive (FP)**). And here is the formula for the IoU metric for a segmentation mask:

$$
\text{IoU} \left( \text{A}, \, \text{B} \right) = \frac {\text{TP}} {\text{TP} + \text{FN} + \text{FP}}
$$

Let’s look at what TP, FP, and FN look like on a segmentation mask:

<figure markdown>
![An example of segmentation mask with results](../assets/images/metrics-iou-seg-mask-results.png)
<figcaption>From left to right: the ground truth segmentation mask, the inference segmentation mask, and the overlay with TP, FP, and FN labeled</figcaption>
</figure>

From the cat image shown above, when you overlay the ground truth and inference masks, the pixels that belong to both
masks are TP. The pixels that only exist in the ground truth mask are FNs, and the pixels that only exist in the
inference mask are FPs. Let's consider the following pixel counts for each category:

<center>

| # True Positives | # False Positives | # False Negatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 25 | 75 |

</center>

Then the IoU becomes:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{IoU} &= \frac {100} {(100 + 25 + 75)} \\[1em]
&= 0.5
\end{align}
$$

### Set of Labels

The set of labels used in multi-label classification tasks is often a
[binarized](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.label_binarize.html) list with a
number of label elements, for example, let’s say there are three classes, `Airplane`, `Boat`, and `Car`, and a sample
is labeled as `Boat` and `Car`. The binary set of labels would then be $[0, 1, 1]$, where each element represents each
class, respectively.

Similar to the segmentation mask, the IoU or Jaccard index metric for the ground truth/inference labels would be the
size of the intersection of the two sets (the number of labels common between two sets, or **TP**) divided by the size
of the union of the two sets (the total number of labels present in both sets, **TP + FN + FP**):

$$
\text{IoU} \left( \text{A}, \, \text{B} \right) = \frac {\text{TP}} {\text{TP} + \text{FN} + \text{FP}}
$$

The IoU for multi-label classification is defined per class. This technique, also known as one-vs-the-rest (OvR),
evaluates each class as a binary classification problem. Per-class IoU values can then be aggregated using different
[averaging methods](./averaging-methods.md). The popular choice for this workflow is **macro**, so let’s take a look at
examples of different averaged IoU/Jaccard index metrics for multi-class multi-label classification:

**Example: macro IoU of ground truth and inference label sets: `Airplane`, `Boat`, `Car`**

<center>

| Set | Sample #1 | Sample #2 | Sample #3 | Sample #4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ground truth | `Airplane`, `Boat`, `Car` | `Airplane`, `Car` | `Boat`, `Car` | `Airplane`, `Boat`, `Car` |
| inference | `Boat` | `Airplane`, `Boat`, `Car` | `Airplane`, `Boat`, `Car` | `Airplane`, `Boat`, `Car` |

</center>

$$
\text{ground truth} = [[1, 1, 1], \, [1, 0, 1], \, [0, 1, 1], \, [1, 1, 1]]
$$

$$
\text{inference} = [[0, 1, 0], \, [1, 1, 1], \, [1, 1, 1], \, [1, 1, 1]]
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\text{IoU}_\text{macro} &= \frac {\text{IoU}_\texttt{Airplane} + \text{IoU}_\texttt{Boat} + \text{IoU}_\texttt{Car}}
{3} \\[1em]
&= \frac {\frac 2 4 + \frac 3 4 + \frac 3 4} {3} \\[1em]
&= \frac 2 3
\end{align}
$$


## Limitations and Biases

IoU works well to measure the overlap between two sets, whether they are types of geometry or a list of labels. However,
this metric cannot be directly used to measure the overlap of an inference and `iscrowd` ground truth, which is an
annotation from [COCO Detection Challenge Evaluation](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data) used to label a large
groups of objects (e.g., a crowd of people). Therefore, the inference is expected to take up a small portion of the
ground truth region, resulting in a low IoU score and a pair not being a valid match. In this scenario, a variation of
IoU, called [intersection over foreground (IoF)](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/issues/393), is preferred.
This variation is used when there are ground truth regions you want to ignore in evaluation, such as `iscrowd`.

The second limitation of IoU is measuring the localization performance of non-overlaps. IoU ranges from 0 (no overlap)
to 1 (complete overlap), so when two bounding boxes have zero overlap, it’s hard to tell how bad the localization
performance is solely based on IoU. There are variations of IoU, such as
[signed IoU (SIoU)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12365.pdf) and
[generalized IoU (GIoU)](https://giou.stanford.edu/GIoU.pdf), that aim to measure the localization error even when there
is no overlap. These metrics can replace IoU metric if the objective is to measure the localization performance of
non-overlaps.
