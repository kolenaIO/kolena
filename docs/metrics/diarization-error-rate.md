# Diarization Error Rate

Diarization Error Rate (DER) is an important metric used to evaluate speaker diarization systems. It quantifies the
overall performance of a speaker diarization system by measuring the ratio of the duration of errors to the total
ground truth speech duration. DER is calculated as a score bounded below by 0 — 0 being a perfect match, with the
score increasing as the duration of errors increases.

## Implementation Details

### Background

To simplest way to quantify the error in a candidate diarization is to measure the duration of false alarms, missed
detections, and speaker confusions. These three elementary errors form the building blocks of diarization error rate.

??? example "False Alarm"
    False alarm is duration of non-speech classified as speech — analagous to false positive diarizations. Using the
    following hypothetical ground truth and inference diarization segments, let's calculate our false alarm duration.

    ```python
    from pyannote.core import Segment, Annotation

    ground_truth = Annotation()
    ground_truth[Segment(0, 10)] = 'A'
    ground_truth[Segment(13, 21)] = 'B'
    ground_truth[Segment(24, 32)] = 'A'
    ground_truth[Segment(32, 40)] = 'C'

    inference = Annotation()
    inference[Segment(2, 14)] = 'A'
    inference[Segment(14, 15)] = 'C'
    inference[Segment(15, 20)] = 'B'
    inference[Segment(23, 36)] = 'C'
    inference[Segment(36, 40)] = 'D'
    ```

    ![Visualization](../assets/images/metrics-der-example1.png)

    Upon inspection, at time segments `[10, 13]` and `[23, 24]`, our candidate diarization contains speech that
    doesn't exist in the ground truth diarization. Thus, our false alarm is equal to $3 + 1 = 4$ seconds.

??? example "Missed Detection"
    Missed detection is the duration of speech classified as non-speech — analagous to a false negative in our
    diarizations. Using the previous example, let's calculate our missed detection duration.

    ![Visualization](../assets/images/metrics-der-example1.png)

    The model failed to detect speech at time segments `[0, 2]` and `[20, 21]`. Thus, our missed detection detection
    sums up to 3 seconds.

??? example "Speaker Confusion"
    Speaker confusion is the duration of speech that has been misidentified. Once again, let's use the previous
    example to calculate our speaker confusion duration.

    ![Visualization](../assets/images/metrics-der-example1.png)

    In the segment `[13, 14]`, our candidate misidentifies speaker `B` as speaker `A`. In segment `[14, 15]`, our
    candidate misidentifies `B` as `C`. In segment `[24, 32]`, the candidate misidentifies `A` as `C`. Finally,
    in segment `[36, 40]`, `C` is misidentified as `D`. In total, our speaker confusion amounts to 14 seconds.

### Definition

Formally, DER is defined as the duration of false alarm, missed detection, and speaker confusion errors
divided by the ground truth duration.

$$
\text{DER} = \frac{\text{false alarm} + \text{missed detection} + \text{speaker confusion}}{\text{ground truth duration}}
$$

### Example

Using the following time segments, let's calculate the DER of the candidate text.

```python
from pyannote.core import Segment, Annotation

ground_truth = Annotation()
ground_truth[Segment(0, 5)] = 'C'
ground_truth[Segment(5, 9)] = 'D'
ground_truth[Segment(10, 14)] = 'A'
ground_truth[Segment(14, 15)] = 'D'
ground_truth[Segment(17, 20)] = 'C'
ground_truth[Segment(22, 25)] = 'B'

inference[Segment(0, 8)] = 'C'
inference[Segment(11, 15)] = 'A'
inference[Segment(17, 21)] = 'C'
inference[Segment(23, 25)] = 'B'
```

??? example "Step 1. Calculate Error Durations"
    <b>False Alarm</b> <br>
    Our candidate diarization contains speech that doesn't exist in the ground truth diarization at time
    segment `[20, 21]`. Our false alarm duration is 1 second.

    <b>Missed Detection</b><br>
    Our model fails to detect speech at time segments `[8, 9]`, `[10, 11]` and `[22, 23]`. Our missed detection
    duration is 3 seconds.

    <b>Speaker Confusion</b><br>
    Our candidate misidentifies speaker `D` as `C` at time segment `[5, 8]` and misidentifies speaker `D` as `A`
    in segment `[14, 15]`. Our speaker confusion duration is 4 seconds.

??? example "Step 2. Calculate Diarization Error Rate"
    Using the formula, we get:

    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \text{DER} &= \frac{\text{false alarm} + \text{missed detection} + \text{speaker confusion}}{\text{ground truth duration}} \\
               &= \frac{1 + 3 + 4}{20} \\
               &= 0.4
    \end{align*}
    $$

    <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

    Our diarization error rate is 0.4.

## Limitiations and Biases

Though DER provides a strong insight into the accuracy of speaker labels and predicted segments, it fails to
pinpoint the specific components of a speaker diarization system that may cause it to perform poorly. As such,
it is a good metric to evaluate the overall performance of a diarization system, but should be used alongside
targeted metrics such as [detection error rate](https://pyannote.github.io/pyannote-metrics/reference.html#detection)
and [segmentation coverage](https://pyannote.github.io/pyannote-metrics/reference.html#segmentation) to evaluate
the individual models that detect voice activity, or speaker changes. Furthermore, diarization error rate does not
place any weight on the accuracy of generated transcript texts, as it is used solely to measure the error in a
diarization system.
