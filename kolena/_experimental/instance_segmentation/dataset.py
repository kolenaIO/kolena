Compute metrics and upload results of the model for the dataset.

Dataframe `df` should include a `locator` column that would match to that of corresponding datapoint. Column
:inference in the Dataframe `df` should be a list of scored [`Polygons`][kolena.annotation.Polygon].

:param dataset_name: Dataset name.
:param model_name: Model name.
:param df: Dataframe for model results.
:param ground_truths_field: Field name in datapoint with ground truth polygons, defaulting to `"ground_truths"`.
:param raw_inferences_field: Column in model result DataFrame with raw inference polygons,
defaulting to `"raw_inferences"`.
:param iou_threshold: The [IoU â†—](../../metrics/iou.md) threshold, defaulting to `0.5`.
:param threshold_strategy: The confidence threshold strategy. It can either be a fixed confidence threshold such
    as `0.5` or `0.75`, or `"F1-Optimal"` to find the threshold maximizing F1 score..
:param min_confidence_score: The minimum confidence score to consider for the evaluation. This is usually set to
    reduce noise by excluding inferences with low confidence score.
